                    <p>Learning to ride a bicycle was another big milestone for Shreya, and it was nothing short of an adventure. Armed with determination and excitement, she spent days practicing with training wheels and her dad by her side, steadying the bike. There were a few falls and plenty of encouragement from the family, but Shreya never gave up. The moment finally arrived when she balanced perfectly and pedaled forward on her own, without any help. The triumphant smile on her face as the wind brushed against her cheeks was priceless. She zoomed down the street with her family cheering her on, making it a moment filled with pride, happiness, and Shreyaâ€™s signature sparkle of achievement.ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’–</p>
